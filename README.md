# TerraFork

![a 3d terrain](https://kellycode.github.io/TerraFork/preview.jpg)

Vanilla JS Fork of https://github.com/spacejack/terra

Updated to THREE r147

Terra is brilliant but not particularly useful in its typescriptified state.  The grass needs to be a module that can be plugged into/onto any ground object and it should be a fairly direct process to add variety.

Typescript removed. 
Organized a bit.

TODOs:  
Add a gulp builder for minification  
Extract the grass/wind bits for easy use
